She is friendly and professional - keeping in touch about party arrangements and giving a clear description of what the party will involve. We had Natasha playing Elsa and she was just perfect - amazing with the children, energetic, engaging and she has a fantastic singing voice. The children (and the adults!) thought she was magical! Thank you, Milly and Natasha :)"

She had such a powerhouse voice and was so sweet with all the kids, keeping them engaged throughout. My daughter still tells people that the REAL Elsa came to her birthday party.    We have 100% trust in Milly and her ability to always supply quality entertainment. Milly herself is incredibly reliable, trustworthy, hardworking…the list goes on! I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend her and will definitely be using her services again."
